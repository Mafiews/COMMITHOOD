Commit'hood is meant to be a bridge between NGOs/charities/associations and people who want to commit themselves to a cause they believe in, but don't know where to look for information, are available only for short a period of time, etc.
The goal is to gather and display all volunteering events on the platform so that members can filter them by interests and register or save them into their dashboard.
Future features can include a chat messaging service, reviews, and much more.
